With the accurate data analyzed by the WPCafe plugin, you can now take the correct move for your restaurant to grow and plan out [great marketing strategies that will bring sales](https://themewinter.com/restaurant-marketing-ideas-that-bring-sales/) to your restaurant. 

##Google Map Food Store Location##

If you run a restaurant that has **Location based food menu**, using google Maps for showing food store locations will be a huge plus point for you. 

You can add the google map coordinates of your store on the website if you use WPCafe. With this feature, your customers can get a better idea of your store location. If you have **restaurant ordering** business that has **multivendors**, customers can check location-wise restaurants.

Go check out our demo page to see how the [Google Map Food Store Location](https://product.themewinter.com/wpcafe/google-map-food-store-location/) works

##Google Auto-complete Address##

Now, you can lessen your customer’s checkout time with Google Auto-complete Address feature. When the customers are at the checkout page, they don’t need to write down their whole address in the address field. Google will auto-complete the address on its own. 

Little things like these are what make the customers happy and slowly become a regular person in your restaurant. 

To know how to set up the [Google Auto-complete Address](https://support.themewinter.com/docs/plugins/plugin-docs/delivery-module/google-autocomplete-address-in-the-checkout/) feature, check out our documentation. 

##Setting Minimum Order Amount##

As a restaurant manager/owner, with WPCafe, you have the liberty to set a minimum order amount for your products. This means that customers have to order a certain number of burgers or pizza or any food to be able to proceed to checkout. This helps to generate more sales.

Check out our documentation on how to set a [minimum order amount](https://support.themewinter.com/docs/plugins/plugin-docs/delivery-module/minimum-order-amount-to-place-order/) in WPCafe to learn the steps. 

##Minicart##

With WPCafe you also have the option to add a **minicart** to build your **online ordering system for restaurants**. Your customers can add their preferred food into this virtual cart. After choosing their preferred food, customers can then check out food items from the minicart. 

Go see our demo page to get a better idea of how this [minicart](https://product.themewinter.com/wpcafe/) feature works.

To learn how to add [minicart](https://support.themewinter.com/docs/plugins/plugin-docs/food-ordering/minicart-2/) to your website using WPCafe, read our documentation. 

##Order Bump##

When your customer is at the checkout page, WPCafe will give a suggestion on the closest best food item the customer can buy if they are willing to pay a little more extra. This is called order bump. 

Order bump is one of the [most effective techniques to increase sales](https://themewinter.com/how-wpcafe-help-to-boost-sales-on-your-restaurant/#:~:text=Boost%20Sales%20for%20Your%20Restaurant%20with%20Order%20Bump) in today’s ecommerce business scenes.
